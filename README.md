# Zendesk - Task Management App

## How to run the app


Make sure you have npm on your system

#### Install npm

```
brew install npm
```

#### After you have npm installed, install local npm modules

```
cd CURRENT_WEB_APP_DIR
npm install
```

#### After npm modules are installed, start the local server
```
npm start
```

Wait for some minutes, it will open the application in browser, if it doesn't then go to

```
http://localhost:3000
```
